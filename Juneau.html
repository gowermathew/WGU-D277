        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Juneau, named the capital city of Alaska in 1906, is located on the Gastineau Channel and the Alaskan Panhandle. Juneau also sits at the base of Mount Juneau and across the Channel from Douglas Island.
             With a population of around 32000 people it makes Juneau the third most populous city in Alaska. 
            It is known for its stunning natural beauty, including mountains, glaciers, and waterways. The city is named after Joe Juneau, a prospector who discovered gold in the area in the late 19th century.
            Juneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that it is not accessible by road. The only ways to reach the city are by boat or plane. This isolation has helped preserve its natural environment and charm. 
            With an average household income of around 100,513 dollars per year, Juneau sits above the state average for income level.
